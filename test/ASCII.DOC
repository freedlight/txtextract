To be, or not to be - that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of 
outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep, 
no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks which flesh is heir to 
- ah, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep; to sleep, perchance to dream. Aye, there's 
the rub. For in this sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must 
give us pause. Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of 
something after death - that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns - puzzles the will, 
and makes us rather bear those ills that we have than fly to others we know not of. THus does conscience 
make cowards of all, and enterprises of great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, 
and lose the name of action.
